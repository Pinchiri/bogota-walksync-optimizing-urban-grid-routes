# bogota-walksync-optimizing-urban-grid-routes
This project synchronizes the walking routes of two individuals in Bogot√° to ensure simultaneous arrival at a destination. Using graph theory and pathfinding algorithms, it calculates the most efficient paths, considering street conditions and walking speeds, to minimize total walking time.
